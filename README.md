# üöó Car Detection System

A robust computer vision system for vehicle detection, license plate recognition (with Arabic support), speed estimation, and driving behavior analysis‚Äîspecifically tailored for Tunisian traffic surveillance.

---

## üìå Overview

This project integrates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and computer vision tools to analyze traffic videos. It can:
- Detect and track vehicles in real-time.
- Recognize license plates, including Arabic text.
- Estimate vehicle speed from video footage.
- Analyze driver behavior for safety monitoring.
- Collect and preprocess vehicle data from the Tunisian marketplace **Tayara.tn**.
